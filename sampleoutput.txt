    Note: There are many caveats about this data, including that some carts are permitted for many, MANY
    more locations than they occupy. I couldn't find a way to distinguish "active" from "permitted."

    With that caveat, here are some random facts:

    Total of permits: 481
    Approved permits: 184
    Approved truck permits: 171
    Approved cart permits: 13
    Permits with a (lat, long) location: 179

EXTRA CREDIT:
What approved truck (or cart) permit has the most approved permits within 250 meters?

The winner:
  MOMO INNOVATION LLC at 351 CALIFORNIA ST Noodles: Meat & Drinks
